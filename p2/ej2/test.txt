For his more solid education, we are told, he went to Salamanca.But why Rodrigo de Cervantes, who was very poor, should have senthis son to a university a hundred and fifty miles away when he hadone at his own door, would be a puzzle, if we had any reason forsupposing that he did so. The only evidence is a vague statement byProfessor  Tomas  Gonzalez,  that  he  once  saw  an  old  entry  of  thematriculation  of  a  Miguel  de  Cervantes.  This  does  not  appear  tohave been ever seen again; but even if it had, and if the date corre-sponded, it would prove nothing, as there were at least two otherMiguels born about the middle of the century; one of them, more-over, a Cervantes Saavedra, a cousin, no doubt, who was a source ofgreat embarrassment to the biographers.

When Cervantes saw what had befallen them, he charged his com-panions  to  lay  all  the  blame  upon  him,  and  as  they  were  beingbound he declared aloud that the whole plot was of his contriving,and that nobody else had any share in it. Brought before the Dey, hesaid  the  same.  He  was  threatened  with  impalement  and  with  tor-ture; and as cutting off ears and noses were playful freaks with theAlgerines,  it  may  be  conceived  what  their  tortures  were  like;  butnothing could make him swerve from his original statement that heand  he  alone  was  responsible.  The  upshot  was  that  the  unhappygardener was hanged by his master, and the prisoners taken posses-sion of by the Dey, who, however, afterwards restored most of themto their masters, but kept Cervantes, paying Dali Mami 500 crownsfor him. He felt, no doubt, that a man of such resource, energy, anddaring, was too dangerous a piece of property to be left in privatehands; and he had him heavily ironed and lodged in his own prison.If he thought that by these means he could break the spirit or shakethe resolution of his prisoner, he was soon undeceived, for Cervantescontrived before long to despatch a letter to the Governor of Oran,entreating  him  to  send  him  some  one  that  could  be  trusted,  toenable  him  and  three  other  gentlemen,  fellow-captives  of  his,  tomake  their  escape;  intending  evidently  to  renew  his  first  attemptwith  a  more  trustworthy  guide.  Unfortunately  the  Moor  who  car-ried the letter was stopped just outside Oran, and the letter being found upon him, he was sent back to Algiers, where by the order ofthe  Dey  he  was  promptly  impaled  as  a  warning  to  others,  whileCervantes  was  condemned  to  receive  two  thousand  blows  of  thestick, a number which most likely would have deprived the worldof “Don Quixote,” had not some persons, who they were we knownot, interceded on his behalf.
