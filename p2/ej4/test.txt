For his more solid education, we are told, he went to Salamanca.But why Rodrigo de Cervantes, who was very poor, should have senthis son to a university a hundred and fifty miles away when he hadone at his own door, would be a puzzle, if we had any reason forsupposing that he did so. The only evidence is a vague statement byProfessor  Tomas  Gonzalez,  that  he  once  saw  an  old  entry  of  thematriculation  of  a  Miguel  de  Cervantes.  This  does  not  appear  tohave been ever seen again; but even if it had, and if the date corre-sponded, it would prove nothing, as there were at least two otherMiguels born about the middle of the century; one of them, more-over, a Cervantes Saavedra, a cousin, no doubt, who was a source ofgreat embarrassment to the biographers.
